# Overview

This project demonstrates a CRUD API built with TypeScript and Express. The purpose of this software is to solidify my understanding of TypeScript's syntax and advanced features by implementing a user management system that includes recursive data validation, object-oriented design, and asynchronous operations. In addition, this project enhances my knowledge of TypeScript's static typing and error handling, which are essential for building reliable and maintainable applications.

The software provides an API to create, read, update, and delete users (CRUD) and utilizes TypeScript to define strong types for entities, improve error handling, and validate input data using recursive functions. The result is a robust API that can be extended and maintained efficiently.

# Development Environment

- **IDE**: Visual Studio Code
- **Runtime**: Node.js
- **Libraries**: TypeScript, Express, Nodemon, and ts-node-dev for live-reloading during development.

# Useful Websites

- [TypeScript Documentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/)
- [Express Documentation](https://expressjs.com/)
- [Nodemon Documentation](https://nodemon.io/)

# Future Work

- **Implement Database Integration**: Currently, the API uses in-memory data storage. Adding a database like MongoDB or PostgreSQL would improve persistence.
- **Enhance Validation Logic**: Add more complex validation rules and error handling to ensure data consistency.
- **Add Testing**: Implement unit and integration tests using Jest to ensure API reliability.
